Implementation The latest tech stack in one project :)

### Tech

Movie DB App uses a number of open source projects and propose architecture to work properly:

* Kotlin - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
* Coroutine - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality.
* Dagger2 - A fast dependency injector for Java and Android.
* Retrofit - Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc
* Room DB - Presistent library
* MVVM - a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups: Models hold application data
* Clean Architecture - Practical Software Architecture Solutions from the Legendary Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) By applying universal rules of software architecture
* Unit Test - Make your code safer
* Motion Layout - Easier to animate your layout
* AppInitializer - a straightforward, performant way to initialize components at application startup.
* And More..
