# Movie DB APP

Implementation The latest tech stack in one project :)

### Tech

Movie DB App uses a number of open source projects and propose architecture to work properly:

* [Kotlin] - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
* [Coroutine] - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality.
* [Dagger2] - A fast dependency injector for Java and Android.
* [Retrofit] - Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc
* [Room DB] - Presistent library
* [MVVM] - a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups: Models hold application data
* [Clean Architecture] - Practical Software Architecture Solutions from the Legendary Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) By applying universal rules of software architecture
* [Unit Test] - Make your code safer

And of course Hacker News App itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
